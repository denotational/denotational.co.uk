<p>Probabilistic programming languages serve a formalism for modelling
statistical and probabilistic phenomena.  The crucial new ingredient is the
ability to construct models compositionally.  This formalism allows one to
disambiguate subtle probabilistic behaviour and explicate hidden
assumptions.  It also serves as a well-defined machine-readable format to
enable automatic analysis of models and even execution.  The rapidly
spreading use of statistical modelling in data analysis and artificial
intelligence has produced renewed interest in this well-established area.
Probabilistic programming languages raise unique fundamental semantic
challenges that push the state-of-the-art in programming language theory
and related mathematics.  The semantics community rose to the challenge,
and in the last few years broke new ground in the semantic foundations of
probabilistic programming.</p>

<p>We invite the community to submit articles on all aspects pertaining
to probabilistic programming semantics.   These encompass, but are not
limited to:</p>

<ul>
<li>new development in probabilistic programming semantics</li>
<li>surveys of open challenges in the area</li>
<li>compilation of an extensive existing line of work</li>
<li>mathematical and logical structures underlying probabilistic programming semantics</li>
<li>new connections between semantic structures of probabilistic programming languages</li>
<li>incorporating expressive programming abstractions into probabilistic programming</li>
<li>semantic reasoning about probabilistic programs</li>
</ul>

<a name="submissions"><h2>Submissions</h2></a>

<p>Submissions should follow the
  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/information/instructions-contributors">Mathematical
  Structures in Computer Science guidelines</a>.  Please submit
  through the <a href="https://mc.manuscriptcentral.com/mscs">MSCS
  portal</a>, by 3 February 2020 (anywhere on earth).  Please ensure
  you mark the submission as a candidate for the Probabilistic
  Programming Semantics special issue at the bottom of Step 1.</p>

<a name="timetable"><h2>Important dates (anywhere-on-earth)</h2></a>

<ul>
<li>03 February 2020: submission deadline (extended) </li>
<li>31 October  2020: camera ready version</li>
</ul>

<p>We expect the special issue to be published in early 2021.
