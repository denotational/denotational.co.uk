<h1 id="teaching">Teaching</h1>
<p>I currently do not teach any courses, but I do supervise <a href="teaching/partII.html">Honours (UG4/MInf)</a> and <a href="teaching/partIII.html">MSc</a> projects.</p>
<p>I’m developing a lecture course on <a href="../tdpm-anu-lss-2023">type-driven probabilistic modelling</a>. Having offered it at advanced and introductory, and at undergraduate level, I hope to soon offer regularly. If you are an undergraduate, especially in Edinburgh, and would have liked to see it on offer, please get in touch.</p>
<p>I strive to use my teaching roles to tie cutting-edge research to the broader computer science subject, and to make this material accessible and interesting for students.</p>
<h3 id="past-courses">Past Courses</h3>
<p>While in Cambridge, I was involved with teaching the following courses:</p>
<h4 id="undergraduate">Undergraduate</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Part IA/UG1, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/DiscMath/">Discrete mathematics</a>. Co-developed with <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/">Prof. Marcelo Fiore</a> the course materials (<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/DiscMath/DiscMathNotes.pdf">slides (2013-14)</a>, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/DiscMath/DiscMathWorkouts.pdf">workouts</a>, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1314/DiscMath/DiscMathExerciseSets01-11.pdf">exercise sheets</a>, and their example solutions), and I supervise this course.</p></li>
<li><p>Year 2, <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/inf2c/">Inf2C: Computer Systems and Software Engineering</a> TA.</p></li>
<li><p>Part II, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/DenotSem/">Denotational semantics</a>. I developed an <a href="../teaching/ds-exercises.pdf">exercise sheet</a> used for supervision work by myself and some of the <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/">Lab</a>’s supervisors.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="part-iiimphilmsc">Part III/MPhil/MSc</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/L29/">Advanced Topics in Denotational Semantics</a>. <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mpf23/">Prof. Marcelo Fiore</a> and myself will be offering this new course aimed to bring students up to date with active research in denotational semantics.</li>
</ul>
<p>I also supervised (Cambridge terminology) and tutored (Oxford and Edinburgh terminology) undergraduate courses across the Computer Science curriculum: Cambridge: * Part IB/UG3, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/Semantics/">Semantics</a> and the corresponding <a href="https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/lsi/">Language semantics and implementation</a>. * Part II, <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1415/Types/">Types</a>. * Oxford Computer Science and Joint Schools + Prelims (UG1): + Functional Programming + Design &amp; Analysis of Algorithms + Imperative Programming Parts 1, 2 and 3 + Discrete Mathematics + Linear Algebra + Part A (UG2): + Compilers + Algorithms and Data Structures + Models of Computation</p>
<h4 id="other">Other</h4>
<p>In 2014, I organised a reading group on recursive domain equations (following <a href="../rdes/rde-intro.pdf">these notes</a>) with: * Alex Chadwic * Adam Ścibior</p>
<p>Surprisingly, while reading we found something new about ω-colimits of embedding-projection pairs, which was <a href="../drafts/kammar-locally-determined-colimits.pdf">presented</a> at the <a href="http://www.pps.univ-paris-diderot.fr/~varacca/domains/Domains_XI/Home.html">11th international workshop on domain theory and applications</a>.</p>
<p>Adam and I have had a fruitful collaboration later about the semantics and implementation of probabilistic programming languages.</p>
