<h1>
Foundations for type-driven probabilistic modelling
</h1>
<h3>
<a href="https://comp.anu.edu.au/lss/">LSS@ANU: Logic Summer School at Australian National University</a>
</h3>
<h4>
<a href="http://www.denotational.co.uk">Ohad Kammar</a> 4 December – 15 December 2023
</h4>
<p>The last few years have seen several breakthroughs in the semantic foundations of probabilistic and statistical modelling. In this course, we will use types to introduce, use, and organise abstractions for probabilistic modelling. We will do so first for discrete probability, and then more generally with the recently-developed quasi-Borel spaces. The course is accompanied by exercises, allowing you to develop a working knowledge and hands-on experience during the summer school and after it.</p>

<h4>
Getting help and reporting mistakes
</h4>
<p>Please never hesitate to get in touch. Approach me directly in person during the summer school or by email. You may prefer to ask a question on the #qbs channel on the SPLS Zulip server: <a href="spls.zulipchat.com" class="uri">spls.zulipchat.com</a> . Others would benefit from your question in that case too!</p>
