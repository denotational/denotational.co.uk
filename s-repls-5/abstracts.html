Pittsburgh, USA.<br /> Title: <strong>Invited talk:</strong> Resource
aware ML <br /> Abstract: <br /> In this talk, I will describe the
design and implementation of Resource Aware ML (RAML), a functional
programming language that automatically derives worst-case resource
bounds at compile time.
<P>
RAML is integrated in the OCaml compiler and automatically derives
resource bounds for higher-order polymorphic programs with user-defined
algebraic types. The analysis is parametric in the resource and can
derive bounds for time, memory allocations, and energy usage. The
derived bounds are multivariate resource polynomials which are functions
of different size parameters of algebraic data structures. Bound
inference is fully automatic and reduced to a linear optimization
problem that is passed to an off-the-shelf LP solver.
<P>
<p>I will first introduce type-based amortized resource analysis, the
analysis technique that RAML is based on. Starting from simple examples
and linear resource usage, I will move to polynomial and multivariate
bounds, and highlight challenges such as higher-order functions and
user-defined types. I will then outline the design of the resource-aware
type system, the formal soundness proof with respect to an operational
cost semantics, and the automatic type inference using LP solving.
Finally, I will demonstrate the implementation of Resource Aware ML and
the integration in the OCaml compiler using illustrative examples that
highlight strengths and limitations of the technique.</p>
Bio: <br />Jan Hoffmann is a Tenure-Track Assistant Professor of
Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University. He received his PhD in
2011 from LMU Munich under the direction of Martin Hofmann. His research
interests are in the intersection of programming languages and formal
methods with a focus on quantitative properties of software. He is known
for his work on automatic static cost analysis of programs and the
design and implementation of Resource Aware ML. His current research is
funded by NSF, DARPA-STAC, Schmidt Sciences Grant, and a Google Research
Award. It includes projects such as automatic resource regression
analysis and finding space/time vulnerabilities in Java bytecode. In the
past, Hoffmann has been supported by scholarships of the German Research
Foundation (DFG) and the German National Academic Foundation
(Studienstiftung).

Title: Reasoning about expected run-times of probabilistic programs
<br /> Abstract: <br /> We present a weakest-precondition-style calculus
for reasoning about run-times of deterministic programs and expected
run-times of probabilistic programs. Run-times of loops are defined in
terms of least fixed points of continuous functions acting on an
appropriate run-time domain. We present several proof rules for upper-
and lower-bounding the (expected) run-time of loops. In particular, we
present a very simple, yet complete proof rule for upper bounds based on
just a single run-time invariant. For lower bounds, however, we will
discuss how the analogon of the single-invariant-rule is sound for
deterministic programs, but unsound for probabilistic ones.</p>

<a name="Michael Arntzenius"></a><a href="http://www.rntz.net/">Michael
Arntzenius</a>, University of Birmingham<br /> Title: Finding fixed
points faster <br /> Abstract: <br /> Datalog is a forward-chaining
logic programming language; a Datalog program may be run by repeatedly
applying its inference rules until nothing further is deducible. This
computes the fixed point of a function (applying the inference rules)
over finite sets (of deduced facts).
<P>
Datafun is a higher-order functional skin over a generalized version of
Datalog’s semantics. It generalizes Datalog in two ways: 1. it permits
functional abstraction; 2. it can take fixed-points of functions over
other semilattices, not just finite sets.
<P>
<p>Datalog has an extensive optimization literature. I and my advisor
Neel Krishnaswami aim to generalize Datalog optimizations and apply them
to Datafun. I will present our work in progress, which adapts Cai et
al’s work on incremental lambda-calculus to provide an analogue of
Datalog’s semi-naive evaluation, which avoids unnecessary re-computation
when iterating towards a fixed-point.</p>

<a name="John Wickerson"></a><a
href="https://johnwickerson.github.io/">John Wickerson</a>, Imperial
College London<br /> Title: Hardware synthesis of weakly consistent C
concurrency <br /> Abstract: <br /> Since 2011, the C language has
provided ‘’weak atomics’’ – instructions that allow the implementation
of lock-free algorithms with racy memory accesses, but which don’t
guarantee that all threads have a consistent view of shared memory. Much
work has been done to study the semantics of weak atomics, and how weak
atomics can be implemented, both correctly and efficiently, on
conventional multiprocessors (x86, PowerPC, ARM, …) and on conventional
graphics processors (NVIDIA, AMD, …).
<P>
This talk reports on the first attempt to implement C’s weak atomics on
an unconventional computing device: the field-programmable gate array
(FPGA). FPGAs do not process instructions like conventional processors;
rather, they are configured to implement a particular function in
hardware. This configuring can be done using a ‘high-level synthesis’
tool, given a C program as a specification.
<P>
We implement weak atomics on FPGAs by adjusting the ‘scheduling’
algorithm that maps C instructions to hardware clock cycles. The
scheduling algorithm seeks to satisfy a set of constraints on the
ordering of each thread’s instructions. We show that strong atomics
necessitate many scheduling constraints, and that the weaker
acquire/release/relaxed atomics can be obtained by selectively removing
some constraints.
<P>
We evaluate the performance of our implementation by synthesising
hardware from a C implementation of a fine-grained circular buffer. We
show that using strong atomics instead of conventional locks yields a
2.5x average performance improvement, and that using weak atomics
instead of strong atomics yields a further 1.5x average
whole-application performance improvement.
<P>
<p>This is joint work with Nadesh Ramanathan, Shane T. Fleming, and
George A. Constantinides, all from the Electrical and Electronic
Engineering Dept. at Imperial College London. It has been accepted to
appear as a full paper at the ACM/SIGDA International Symposium on FPGAs
in February.</p>

<a name="David Sherratt"></a><a
href="http://people.bath.ac.uk/drs32/">David Sherratt</a>, University of
Bath<br /> Title: Towards an Atomic Abstract Machine <br /> Abstract:
<br /> The familiar call-by-need evaluation strategy (as used in Haskell
compilers), also known as lazy evaluation shows best performance when
terms are duplicated. When we have more control over the duplication of
the term, such that we can choose which segments of the term to
duplicate, then we can implement full laziness. Full laziness means we
duplicate only what is necessary, and the maximal free subexpressions
(the largest subterms such that, if they contain a bound variable x,
they also contain its binder λx) remain.
<P>
Haskell compilers can perform full laziness at compile time. However,
during runtime the implementation becomes too expensive. The idea behind
this project is to further study the process of implementing a fully
lazy evaluation strategy.
<P>
The purpose of sharing in the λ-calculus is to have better control over
duplication of terms. Sharing is the use of a single representation for
multiple instances of a common subterm. During evaluation, instead of
duplicating a term, we can share it. This allows us to evaluate all the
copies of the subterm simultaneously, by evaluating their shared
representation [6].
<P>
In the atomic λ-calculus [2], we implement two types of closures. The
usual notion of closure is a term with an associated sharing implemented
as a let-construct. The second notion of closure introduces the
distributor construct, which allows for duplication of a term
atomically. The distributor uses a more restricted notion of unsharing
similar to Lamping’s sharing graphs [4] which performs optimal
reductions as defined in [5]. This is exactly what allows this calculus
to perform fully lazy evaluation.
<P>
An abstract machine is a theoretical implementation of a strategy for a
language on an abstract notion of computer architecture, made from
directly implementable constructs. An abstract machine for evaluating
atomic λ-terms would be a fully lazy abstract machine. For my PhD I aim
to develop an atomic abstract machine based off the atomic λ-calculus.
To achieve this, we make all the reduction rules in the calculus local
in the sense of [3]. To achieve this, we construct a new calculus based
on the atomic λ-calculus that makes the variable scopes explicit while
maintaining fully lazy sharing.
<P>
This directed atomic λ-calculus uses a variant of director strings [1]
to make the scopes of terms explicit. When performing substitution,
instead of traversing the complete term, we instead only follow the path
of the variable we want to replace which is highlighted through the
annotations. An application can indicate the location of a variable with
a 0 (in the left hand side) or with a 1 (in the right hand side), and
similar for sharing. The scoping information of terms can then be used
so that all the reduction rules can be considered local. One can then
start work on an abstract machine for this calculus, that performs fully
lazy λ-evaluation.

nominal syntax in the language of diagrams <br /> Abstract: <br /> The
correspondence between various monoidal categories and graphical
languages of diagrams has been studied extensively, leading to
applications in quantum computing and communication, systems theory,
circuit design and more. From the categorical perspectives, diagrams can
be specified using (name-free) combinators which enjoy elegant
equational properties. However, established notations for diagrammatic
structures, such as hardware description languages (VHDL,
extsc{Verilog}) or graph languages ( extsc{Dot}), use a totally
different style, which is flat, relational, and reliant on extensive use
of names (labels). Such languages are not known to enjoy nice syntactic
equational properties. However, since they make it relatively easy to
specify (and modify) arbitrary diagrammatic structures they are much
more popular than the combinator-style specifications. This parallels
the situation in programming languages, where combinator-based languages
(e.g. APL) proved to be far less popular than languages with variables.
In this paper we show how the two approaches to diagram syntax can be
reconciled and unified in a way that does not change the original
categorical semantics and the existing (categorical) equational theory.
We also show how the two notations are semantically complementary and we
give sound and complete equational theories.</p>

Cambridge<br /> Title: Improving Agda’s equational reasoning with
reflection <br /> Abstract: <br /> Agda is a Haskell-style programming
language, whose dependent type system allows it to function as an
elegant theorem proving language. But compared to similar languages like
Coq, Agda lacks a built-in tactic language. Instead, users are
encouraged to write libraries to ease reasoning in Agda itself. As an
example of this, equational reasoning combinators are often used to lay
out proofs by transitivity. These combinators allow the Agda code to
resemble standard pen-and-paper equational reasoning proofs. But where a
pen-and-paper proof might simply invoke, say, ‘commutativity’ between
steps, in Agda we must specify the exact proof that takes us from one
step to the next. This can often be very tedious.
<P>
<p>In this talk, I will present a new library that eliminates one of the
more annoying parts of this process: invoking congruence, which allows
us to provide a lambda expression to locate a subterm to rewrite.
However, these lambda expressions often amount to duplicating a lot of
code. They are both tedious and error-prone to write, and ugly to read.
My library uses Agda’s reflection API to automate this. Instead of
providing a lambda expression, the user simply annotates the lefthand
expression to specify where to rewrite. This improves both ease of
writing Agda code, and the readability of the resulting proofs.</p>

Higher-order imperative programs are well-known as a source of
small-but-ferociously-difficult-to-verify-programs. Languages like ML
permit the subtle interplay of features like generative name creation,
pointers to code, and type abstraction. Each of these features requires
sophisticated mathematics to model, and their combination yields models
of daunting complexity.
<P>
In recent years, the standard technique for analysing these programs
have been based on step-indexed logical relations. However, while
step-indexing is well-suited to proving safety properties, it is less
able to establish liveness properties such as termination.
<P>
<p>In this talk, I will describe some in-progress research on how to
prove termination of higher-order imperative programs by combining ideas
from process algebra, separation logic, and logical relations.</p>
